 Given the string word , return the minimum total distance to type such string using only two fingers . The distance between coordinates ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) is | x 1-x 2 | + | y 1-y 2 | .
 All the friends are divided into pairs . The pairings are given in a list pairs , where pairs [ i ] = [ x i , y i ] denotes x i is paired with y i and y i is paired with x i .
 undergroundSystem.getAverageTime ( " Paradise " , " Cambridge " ) ; / / return 14.00000 . There was only one travel from " Paradise " ( at time 8 ) to " Cambridge " ( at time 22 )
 Given an array nums of positive integers . Your task is to select some subset of nums , multiply each element by an integer and add all these numbers . The array is said to be good if you can obtain a sum of 1 from the array by any possible subset and multiplicand .
 Explanation : Alice will always lose . Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6 . Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins .
 Now , given string arrays queries and words , return an integer array answer , where each answer [ i ] is the number of words such that f ( queries [ i ] ) &lt; f ( W ) , where W is a word in words .
 You are given a string text of words that are placed among some number of spaces . Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space . It's guaranteed that text contains at least one word .
 When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions , we take the union of possibilities .
 Calling Successor ( Alice , curOrder ) will return Jack , so we append to curOrder to get [ " king " , " Alice " , " Jack " ] .
 Explanation : Please take care of the mod .
 If target is found in the array return its index , otherwise , return-1 .
 You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image , rotate the image by 90 degrees ( clockwise ) .
 Explanation : The maximum integer in M is 2 , and there are four of it in M . So return 4 .
 Explanation : Given the above perfect binary tree ( Figure A ) , your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node , just like in Figure B . The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers , with' #' signifying the end of each level .
 1 . If the file contains less than 10 lines , what should you output ?
 Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction , you need to return the calculation result in string format . The final result should be irreducible fraction . If your final result is an integer , say 2 , you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator 1 . So in this case , 2 should be converted to 2/1 .
 No other pairs satisfy the condition , so we return the max of 4 and 1 .
 We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values , and the values x and y of two different nodes in the tree .
 Since the answer may be too large , return it modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7 .
 The given tree [ 4,2,6,1,3 , null , null ] is represented by the following diagram :
 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers . The digits are stored in reverse order , and each of their nodes contains a single digit . Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list .
 Given an integer k , return the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to k . The same Fibonacci number can be used multiple times .
 Explanation : Given the above binary tree ( Figure A ) , your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node , just like in Figure B . The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers , with' #' signifying the end of each level .
 The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node .
 Since the answer may be too large , return it modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7 .
 The first element output [ 0 ] has output [ 0 ] . val = 1 , output [ 0 ] . next = null .
 On an 8 x 8 chessboard , there is one white rook . There also may be empty squares , white bishops , and black pawns . These are given as characters' R' ,' .' ,' B' , and' p' respectively . Uppercase characters represent white pieces , and lowercase characters represent black pieces .
 How many valid permutations are there ? Since the answer may be large , return your answer modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7 .

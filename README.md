# Service-Requirement-Extraction-via-NLP
This is a program that can use to extract the service requirements from texts which are from users. The program is python-based and now is a primitive version. For
now, it can only deal with the sentence like Given (...) return (...). It will transfer the texts into IOPE tuple-based format.

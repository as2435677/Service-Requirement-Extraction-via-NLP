 Regulatory market participants like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and public market exchanges like the Nasdaq and NYSE house information that’s necessary for investors. However, writing code to integrate with and synchronize data with these entities is far from straightforward.
On one hand, the SEC website contains a flood of information about companies. On the other hand, their data are often not up to date, or can only be accessed through convoluted and unreliable technical backchannels.
